Was a Youth Worker/Community Learning Worker amongst other things before joining.

Preferred my old career but it offered zero stability. 

The Police isn’t as rewarding because you don’t often get the opportunity to work with people for an extended period of time and actually see the difference you’re making.

That being said when I was in the domestic abuse enquiry/investigation team I felt that was truly rewarding, putting hours upon hours into building a case and seeing people actually get handed serious time was good.

My current role is a lot of sitting and watching people, collating evidence for months. Again it can be quite rewarding.

I don’t miss working on response all that much, it’s exciting and you experience a great deal in the role but it’s under resourced and quite frankly the lack of resources puts response officers in danger they shouldn’t be in.",AskUK,2023-11-21 13:46:40,2023-11-21 13:46:52.059059

England is generally less direct and directive in its language meanings more ambiguous and elliptical. Simple phrases like ‘quite nice’  can have many shades of meaning. Optimism is not considered a such a virtue as in the US.

Wealth still matters less as a mark of worth than in the US. Social trust is higher litigation lower and we have few guns. Regionalism and tribalism are much stronger. People are more happy to be considered eccentric quirky maverick or just plain odd.

It rains a lot but  the weather is rarely hostile to human existence, so we don’t really do air conditioning.

Tradition and precedent play a much bigger role in business than in the US but although we have a long history we are also a new country due to high levels of immigration and the Imperial past is just a story with no real meaning.

99uaq7o0,ka5pr99,rob2o6,"Honestly I have had very similar experiences with both mental health problems and skin problems. GPs fail to take symptoms seriously which leads to worsening of condition. I get a feeling many Doctors think you are crying wolf when you’re an otherwise “healthy” young man. However I wasn’t crying wolf on all the above occasions.

I finally got treatment for depression and complex PTSD by paying for a therapist out of my own pocket. After trying for years to access services through the NHS (and my GP) only to get told to make lifestyle changes! 

I also had a random bout of eczema in my early twenties after having not suffered with it since being a small child. 

I asked to see a specialist as I found the circumstances very bizarre. My GP refused and prescribed steroids which I had a bad rebound reaction to, so when I went back they prescribed stronger topical steroids… which lead to an even worse rebound reaction. My skin dried out terribly thanks to the steroids. It then got infected with impetigo during the re-bound reaction. They finally put in for a referral to see a dermatologist (3 month waiting list). 2 months later I moved to Wales and lost the referral to dermatology. I spent the next 6 months in constant pain with terrible skin due to the rebound reaction and some underlying problem. And it took over a year for my skin to recover from the reaction induced by the steroids. 

I went to see my new GP (in Wales) when I got an infection on my face. 4 moths after using the steroid creams. The new welsh GP didn’t believe me when I said I needed to see a dermatologist, and that I had previously had a referral. He prescribed more steroids and suspected I may have a bacterial infection. I didn’t use the steroids thankfully which may have saved my life later on. He also gave me another course of antibiotics to sort the infection. These didn’t work and the infection spread across my face.

Within two days I had a serious fever, my neck swelled up, face was puffy and my entire head was covered in open sores. The works! 

I went to A&E feeling incredibly sick and exhausted. They triaged me and didn’t believe it to be serious so referred me to an out of hours GP. I can’t believe they did this in hindsight given the state I was in. 

The out of hours GP admitted they didn’t know what was wrong and spoke to their senior consultant. The consultant recommended different antibiotics without ever having seen me. I went home with these antibiotics. 

Within another day I was in an even worse state. I was misdiagnosed and untreated for over a week by this point. The infection spread to my eyes which is when I called 111. A GP over the phone finally took me seriously. I said I suspected having picked up herpes from kissing someone and that I had an underlying skin problem. He called the hospital and arranged for me to go in immediately. 

At the hospital they wrongly assumed I had monkey pox despite me telling them it was definitely herpes and that I spoke with the person who I caught it from. They were the only person I had recently had intimate contact with. This person I kissed definitely gets/has cold sores. BUT  NO the triage doctors know better and it’s clearly monkey pox.

They ran tests and I saw both a dermatologist and a consultant from infectious diseases. The consultant from infectious diseases was the only one who listened to me and agreed with me that it was herpes based on my description of events and his own observations. He prescribed me some antivirals immediately. Later tests revealed it definitely was eczema Herpeticum (herpes). Made worse by the topical steroids a few month prior. He told me it was a good thing I had not used the steroids my GP prescribed as I could be in a worse state. If I had continued untreated I could have potentially lost my eyesight or even died.

The consultant launched an internal investigation into the handling of my case and I am now a case study. Ever since my GP has been a lot more understanding whenever I have made contact with them.

That is until I moved back to England. Now when I have any skin problems we’re back to square one. Unfortunately NHS England and NHS Wales don’t share information. 

I have had another skin infection which was impetigo. Unfortunately my GP in England misdiagnosed it as herpes (which I have had and told them it’s not that). I spent weeks of them giving me antivirals and not listening to me about it being different. 

I told them I definitely picked this up at the gym and that it definitely is bacterial. After a few days of messing me around they eventually took swabs but told me to carry on with the antivirals. In the meantime the infection spread all over my torso and up my back. I was in serve pain with a high temperature and eventually took myself to A&E. 

The Doctor at A&E gave me 5 days of antibiotics which helped. I saw my GP again a few days after and told them the antibiotics are working. But the GP continued to tell me it’s herpes despite the evidence to the contrary. And despite me having been on the treatment for herpes and it not getting better. When I finished the course of antibiotics it still hadn’t quite cleared up, then it got worse.

I went back to the GP nearly a week later for her to tell me it’s clearly herpes (she didn’t even look at my skin this time) and that she will put in an urgent referral to dermatology (takes 72 hours). She said to keep taking the antivirals… I asked her about the swabs they took over a week ago. She checked the results which clearly said Staphylococcus (the bacteria which causes impetigo). But no, she disregarded this for her own opinion based on her unconscious bias - that it is definitely a return of the herpes. I left the surgery completely defeated thinking I’m going crazy!

So the next day I’m in extreme pain covered in open sores. Haven’t slept properly for three weeks. So I went to the pharmacist to get some strong pain killers. The pharmacist took a look at my skin and he said to go to urgent care and get another opinion as he was very concerned for me. 

I’m still waiting to be seen at the urgent care unit…",AskUK,2023-11-21 13:58:54,2023-11-21 13:59:06.803901

my43fvbb,ka5pvh4,180d1op,"2 years in our new build and this is what has been sorted/fixed or still needs fixed:

- new internal doors as they were supposed to fit fire doors and did not.

- whole house painted as they never did the final coat of paint before we moved in

- showers resealed twice as they were leaking

- no insulation in the eaves so walls had to be cut open, insulation fitted, falls remediated, replastered/repainted etc

- they’ve used the wrong paint when fixing the walls from the insulation issue so waiting on them coming back out to paint again 

- the soil vent pipe from the toilets was venting into the attic instead of outside so they had to fix that. They knocked some roof tiles off in the process so waiting for those to be fixed also

- broken roof tiles on the sunroom had to be replaced 

- wood burning fire wasn’t sealed correctly on installation so smoke was backing up into the living room

- some radiators weren’t heating up correctly so system had to be rebalanced

- boiler was leaking so that needed fixed

- kitchen sink was leaking, that needed fixed

- pressure in the system was too high and when we ran the hot water, the tank made this unholy high pitched noise which was annoying so that needed fixed. 

- issue with the sealing on the underside of the eaves outside (not completely sure but hubby knows)

- some fixes needed on the windowsills outside. Pointwork was crappy.

When we land, I get a voicemail that my dad tried to go to the store on his own and fell and broke his hip. Apparently we didn’t need anything but he had 6 cases of diet seven up, Bali he, and tried to buy whiskey but forgot his ID. When he was putting stuff away, he let go of the cart, it started to roll, he reached and fell.

I told my family we didn’t need to do thanks giving or we could just grab pizza. My mom and sister insisted on still doing Thanksgiving and how easy it would be.

Fast forward and we came over early offering to help but my sister denied us. As the day went on my sister got really sick and had food poisoning. At one point she was curled up on the couch with a blanket over her head and then went home leaving her husband and two children who are very attached to her.

My mom kept having mini melt downs through the day switching between what an idiot my father is, why did we need balogne on Thanksgiving, and we shouldn’t have tried to do Thanksgiving today.  The breakdowns likely not helping, she, as usual, underestimated the time required to cook a turkey. 

By the time we ate, my sisters kids were both having melt downs without her and my dad was texting from the hospital upset that she hadn’t brought him a plate of food yet.

Sadly most old houses have been maintained or ‘done up’ by builders who don’t have the knowledge or experience needed to look after old buildings. It’s absolutely normal, but not right, that old buildings are filled with cement, concrete, plastic damp proof membranes, gypsum plasters and kingspan type insulation. Old buildings need vapour permeable materials and an understanding of how to work on them without making things worse.

Modern buildings by contrast are built with modern materials and can be very good, they can also be appalling. I’d avoid anything from a volume house builder - persimmon, Barrett’s etc.

This means Taiwan is now largely not an internationally recognised nation - officially, even if it is in reality - which means that it for example only has formal diplomatic relations with twelve (largely insignificant, frankly) countries and very few trade deals. Basically, it puts a bit of a strangehold on Taiwan, especially because its neighbour considers it a breakaway province and Taiwan doesn't sit at the same diplomatic tables to be able to influence other countries to its point of view.

As for why America, simply because America is the most powerful country in the world. The tacit recognition (officially neutral on TWese independence) position does at least guarantee Taiwan/the ROC some security. If it didn't have that, it'd have absolutely been invaded by the PRC by now.

As an extra complication, there's also a movement in Taiwan from one side of the political spectrum to declare Taiwanese independence, which would basically cause the Republic of China to cease to exist. However, China/the People's Republic of China is also against that as it would consider Taiwan to go from being a rebellious/unsubdued province to a breakaway separatist movement, which it's also against in Xinjiang and Tibet.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 14:12:53,2023-11-21 14:13:06.158347

Nice and warm and plenty of space.
We were able to buy a 4 bed new build with good sized rooms but had we not gone down the new build route it would have been a three bed with the third room being a box room. BUT a bigger garden as ours is small.

I like gardening and we have made it nice and in the future I’d like a bigger garden but this suits it’s purpose, especially whilst we are in full time employment and haven’t lots of time.
I do have grey carpets and laminate flooring but that’s only as a base colour so I have colour elsewhere 😂

And in some other developments you see major issues get through their 'rigorous sign off' process, like walls not being straight, brickwork so bad it needs torn down and re-done, missing weatherproofing, extractor fans not connected to external vents, doors hung so badly they catch without closing, bad wiring, rendering that falls off the exteriors.

2v5w4acu,ka5xwnh,180ibiv,"I’ve worked in HR supporting both the US & Europe. 

The difference you’re referring to is “at-will” employment vs an employment contract.  Forty nine of the 50 states are at-will states.   In the US, you will often receive an offer letter that outlines the terms and conditions of employment.  It’s less detailed than a contract and less legally binding.  

Essentially, in the US either party can exit the employment relationship at will.  It’s customary, but not required, for employees to give 2 weeks notice when quitting.  

Company policies & employment laws (Federal, State & sometimes local) dictate a lot of what gets covered in an employment contract.  Policies can change at any time. 

In practice, things operate similarly.  Just because companies can change things at will, doesn’t mean it’s an everyday occurrence.

k3ovsgk7,ka60qa0,180du7n,"[Taiwan opinion polls.](https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&id=6963)

As you can see, only a tiny minority of Taiwanese people want independence now. As Taiwan’s largest benefactor, the US recognizing their independence would be forcing them into a course of action which most of the population does not want.

At the same time, an even smaller portion of the population wants to reunify with China right away. By arming Taiwan but not recognizing their independence, we allow them to delay reunification until a point that they decide is ideal.

Personally, I think this is the best balance to strike in a bad situation. China, much like Korea, is divided not by historical culture but by the political consequences of the Cold War. While there is some inherent injustice to this state of affairs, I think there is also some inherent value to the form of government practiced in the ROC and ROK vs. that practiced in the PRC and DPRK. I think the majority of Taiwanese and South Koreans would agree. As such, I think it is fitting for the US to exercise its influence so that the interests of the people are represented during peaceful reunification negotiations, rather than simply allowing military reunifications where only the interests of dictators are represented. 

Unfortunately, at this point, negotiations appear to be a non-starter. The two sides are too far apart. Hopefully this will change in coming years, and when it does we should celebrate that development.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 15:15:13,2023-11-21 15:15:24.626657

e8mtuxqw,ka60u5z,18029qb,"So most places are laid out logically if you pay attention - google maps, etc, just makes it really easy to not pay attention.

I grew up in a good sized, dense suburb (20,000 people packed into 6 square miles) and the entire thing can be fairly easily divided in your brain between a couple of truly main roads - these are typically ones that go ""through"" the suburb and into other places - they connect to highways. Then there are major roads - these largely transverse the suburb but don't ""go anywhere"" other than from one side to the other. Off of the major roads are main streets - these typically are only used to get to ""side streets"" but they're still known roads.

So if I'm going to make something up, to get to your friends house, you'd know that you leave your street - say it is a side street called Pine St. Pine St connects to Maple Ave - Maple Ave is a main street that connects to Chestnut Rd. Chestnut road is a Major Road that will take you to Rt 42 and Rt 42 is a Main Road - that will take you to the next town over, to the airport, to the highway, etc.

However once you're on Rt 42 you can take that down to a different Major Road, and take that to a main street, and that to a side street. Basically geography is less complicated than you think it is.

It gets even easier when you know how addresses work in your town and even easier than that if your suburb was designed on a grid.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 15:15:56,2023-11-21 15:16:08.686273

te3ia,ka61dui,180grih,"The UK's climate is very region-dependent, especially in terms of the extremes of what's possible within a summer or winter season.

The months of April to September in London or SE England are very different to what they are in, say, the North-West of Wales, or the Scottish Lowlands. For instance, 30c+ summer days are not unusual nowadays throughout summer for Southern England. Whereas in Scotland or Wales, 30c+ days would be nearing the realms of 'record breaking temps'. Likewise, London or SE England may get a few days of snow in an entire Winter season, if you're lucky. But much up the more upland areas of the UK will have snow for weeks during winter, pretty reliably, sometimes until well into Spring. 

There are overall facets of the country's climate we can discuss though. As a rule, its very dull and grey, regardless of the area you live. Courtesy of being an Island in Northern Europe, floating in the Atlantic. Obviously, London is sunnier / less dull than Manchester, Glasgow or Newcastle, but it's all relative - the most sunny parts of the UK are still significantly less sunny than the vast majority of other countries. So, unless they come from the likes of Coastal Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Newfoundland or Ireland, someone who has never been to the UK will find the climate/weather very dull by virtue of this. 

A great example of this is how many Americans who live in the Pacific NW, such as Seattle, bemoan how 'dull' the climate is. However, Seattle (one of, it not the, least sunny cities in the USA) still gets 2,200 annual sunshine hours on average, beating London's 1,675 by nearly a quarter, lol. Which puts things into perspective. 

The upside to the UK's dull, maritime climate is a (general) lack of extreme weather. It's usually within the range of 10c to 17/18c and slightly overcast for the majority of the year. This means the UK mostly avoids the blistering heatwaves that central Europe sometimes gets, as well as the brutal, dangerous winters that areas in the USA on a similar latitude get every year without fail. 

The main gripe to this pretty benign climate is one of unpredictability. The stereotype about Brits discussing the weather alot, stems off the back of the weather often behaving in utterly random, unexpected ways. It's not because they 'love' the weather. It's because the forecast could predict one thing, and then the reality ends up completely different (perhaps ruining your outdoor plans, or meaning you didn't dress properly for the weather, etc). It can be rather frustrating. It also means that you could get basically the same weather in November or March, as you could do in the middle of July (in this case, overcast, drizzle and 16c lol). This is actually quite rare when looking at things globally. Seasons are not always clearly defined here, outside of daylight hours. 

TL;DR:

* Dull (significantly less sunshine hours per year than most other places in the world)
* General lack of extreme weather - ultimately a benign climate from a liveability perspective
* Random, unpredictable weather patterns at times of the year you wouldn't necessarily associate it with (""It's June, why is it 15c and raining, shouldn't it be summer now?"" etc)
* Rains less than you think, but it does drizzle alot
* Very pleasant in the April to September period of the year. Everything is very green, daylight hours are long, and the weather rarely hot to the degree that it prevents you from doing things",AskUK,2023-11-21 15:19:30,2023-11-21 15:19:47.562572

n03ty4bcd,ka61p9p,180ibiv,"An individual is generally either an employee or an independent contractor. The main difference between the two is the amount of control the individual has over their work. If their employer requires the individual to perform his work at a certain time and in a certain way, he is an employee. If the individual has the liberty of deciding when and how the work will be done he is an independent contractor. This question of control is very important, because even though someone is called an ""independent contractor"" if he is treated like an employee then he will be entitled to the rights of an employee under law. 

Employees have certain rights, such as overtime pay if they work longer than 40 hours a week, medical or family leave, certain anti-discrimination or anti-retaliation protection, compensation if you are injured on the job, and more. This is why many employees don't have a contract, as most of what they are entitled to beyond the rate of pay and certain optional benefits is already covered by state and federal law. 

Employment is at-will, meaning the employee or the employer can terminate the relationship at any time, for (almost) any reason, or no reason. Certain laws prevent an employer from terminating an employee on a discriminatory basis, or in retaliation for reporting a crime or other wrongdoing committed by the employer. 

Independent Contractors, are the name would suggest, usually have a contract. This contract will detail the scope of the work that is to be performed. Some contracts will not be at-will, meaning that terminating the relationship will result in the terminating party being liable for the other's losses. For instance, if you are an engineer employed as an independent contractor who has agreed to work on a certain project, and you decide not to complete that project, then you may be liable to your employer for failing to complete that project. 

While there are federal employment laws, all 50 states have their own employment laws.

They are also quite a lot more expensive so there is an expectation they will be vastly superior. In a lot of cases old buildings are pretty good so the benefits don't often outweigh the extra cost. Also the extra cost is front loaded so your budget may mean you compromise on things you want, whereas with an older house you can get the core requirements (land, rooms, size, etc) and add the desirable items incrementally (energy efficiency, etc).

kne6w,ka62uuc,180ibiv,">It's my understanding that in the UK the contract also stipulates things like how much notice the employee must give if they decide to quit? Which is nit a thing here. 

Yes, that's often even in the offer letter (which is one source of the contract as a whole) as it's an important factor as to if people take a job as notice period works both ways, they have to give you the notice period when you're let go, too. There's nothing legally stopping a business saying a notice period of 0 weeks though. But neither businesses, nor employees actually like a period of 0 as it creates uncertainty - it's most common for it to be two weeks or one month - employers can pay it out instead of having you work it.

>If i can quit anytime, it doesn't seem like a contract. 

That's the least important contract term to me - my contract covers things like pay, hours, holiday, sick pay, a million different HR procedures from raising a grievance to formal absence meetings and so on. Much of it is contained in the ""employee handbook"" or similarly named document, but they're considered contract terms.

No... There is public transport in nearly all medium and large cities in the US. The public transport system is just poor compared to many other countries due to multiple factors. The US is also so big large country wide transport networks is hard to do properly and easily to just do via air.

> no high speed trains

See point 1 but high speed trains in general might work on the east coast and parts of the west coast but that is about it. Much easier to do travel via air.

>you have no small shops in your suburban areas and that your lives are generally addicted to cars.

Different systems for different needs and wants. Many people want that secluded lifestyle a suburban area provides. Things are starting to change but you can't look at something like this through a personal viewpoint as each culture is different from another. 

>I've heard that waiters at the restaurants can even be paid SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR and are supposed to live of of tips that guests leave! My European brain literally can't comprehend this. It shouldn't be the guests responsibility to pay off a waiter. Tips are supposed to be something that the guests leave if they feel like the staff did something great etc etc.

You are failing to understand the system... Yes quite a few places are abusing the system but no the employees will has to make state/federal minimum wage by law. If they do not make it there via tips the employers has to make up the difference.

>I've heard that you have barely any laws that protect you from for example Facebook to steal your data, I've also heard that the new YouTube Anti Adblock thing violates European laws, but yours doesnt

Again our system works differently but to say it that way is frankly false.

>also I generally just heard that your bosses can use you as slaves and that paying off college or hospital billwoululd cost more than what you earned your whole life

Holy fuck is this so off it hurts reading it... You really need to look into how you are getting your information if you think this is even closely correct.

>Also IMO having the possibility to buy a gun in the first supermarket is stupid and generally having the right to everyone have its own weapon of mass destruction is stupid,

Again completely off... you always need to have the same background checks anywhere you buy one and walmart only sells shotguns and rifles used for hunting as the US has a large hunting population.

9zep1asp,ka64lf2,1809xqt,"Yeah class sizes and behaviour made a massive difference to how effective I could be as a teacher. When you have a class of 32 with no teaching assistant and a tonne of them are misbehaving, you have to take SO much time away from actual teaching to put out fires. To tell them to stop misbehaving, offer a warning, or move someone's seats, or send someone out of the room, or go to the system to call for SLT to come, etc. You spend half the lesson putting out fires rather than just being able to get on with teaching. 

During covid I'd teach Key Worker kids once a week, and class sizes had a maximum of 10 kids, but usually less, and they all sat 2 metres apart so you didn't have all the playfights or stealing each other's stuff. I actually had time to individually talk to all of them and help them loads, and wasn't constantly doling out warnings and consequences like I usually needed to. One year 9 girl told me ""I didn't like you when you taught us before, but you're really nice now"". I didn't seem nice because in a class of 30 who were constantly mucking about, I was giving detentions every lesson. And when kids are constantly off task or trying to wind you up and you're having to spend so much time managing it, it gets super draining and you can get a bit grumpy. I never raised my voice, but I wanted to!

And some schools you can't rely on SLT coming when you call them so the students quickly learn that if you say they'll be removed if they continue throwing things you're lying. They know nobody is coming so they can keep mucking about. 

My favourite class I ever had was a tiny class of 6 students with additional needs, who came with two teaching assistants. Yes they had their own challenges, and would sometimes get distressed or yell or cry, but with such a small class size, it was so much quicker to manage the situation without having to worry about the rest of the class going wild behind you while your back was turned to help them. 

I was the same teacher with the same skill set and experience in each class. But my massive unruly classes with no TA support probably thought I was a rubbish teacher and my small classes thought I was brilliant. It makes SUCH a difference.",AskUK,2023-11-21 15:39:57,2023-11-21 15:40:08.894324

On a state level, states create governmental agencies and empower them to develop and enforce regulations around employment. For example, in California, we have the the Department of Industrial Relations which includes the Labor Board. 

If an employee has been maltreated by an employer, the employee has two options. First, the can sue the employer directly. The cause of action would be based on contract law. Alternatively, the employee can file a complaint with the Labor Board. The Board will then investigate, and if they determine the employer violated labor laws or regulations, then they can order the employer to pay backpay and some punitive damages (usually, this means the employer will owe the employee double or triple the back wages or something like that). If the employer doesn't pay, then the Labor Board can sue the employer. At this point, it's not really contract law, since it's not based on a contract between the employer and employee or the government. It's a violation of a lawful regulation, which the Labor Board is authorized to seek damages for in court.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 15:40:11,2023-11-21 15:40:23.761670

Going for a walk as exercise or just something to do? 45mins is the minimum you're aiming to do imo, so short walk.

Walking to the shops? 45mins is a long walk as you can't just ""pop out"".

Walking to a bar or pub to meet friends for the night? Fairly long but one worth doing if the weather is OK and you're staying for a few hours.

Commute to work? Long walk but one I would generally do unless the weather is proper shite as its free and good exercise.

For context I live in Manchester City centre so generally weighing it up against the possibility of public transport. A 45min walk could get me anywhere in the city centre easily and is one I would often do going out or coming home from a night out if its on the opposite side of town.

4fbfy,ka64o2y,180ibiv,"> So if not a contractual obligation, what compels an employer to pay you each month, if not contract law?

Primarily, my state (and most states I'm aware of) enacted a statute called the ""Payment of Wages Act"" which requires employers to pay employees for their work within a certain period of time along with many other requirements, such as notice before changing salary or hourly pay.  Employers who breach the statute can be hit with big penalties, including treble damages and attorney's fees.

As another point, unwritten contracts are perfectly enforceable under the law.  Certain aspects of proof may be more difficult versus a dispute over a written contract, but plaintiffs sue and win breach of verbal contract cases all the time.

The internet isn't real life. 

>  I heard that you have close to no public transport, no high speed trains, you have no small shops in your suburban areas and that your lives are generally addicted to cars.

Depends on where you live. I'd imagine people living in the rural countryside of Poland have to drive their cars more often than people living in Warsaw. 

> I've heard that waiters at the restaurants can even be paid SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR and are supposed to live of of tips that guests leave! 

Those tips can add up to $200 in a single evening. Every waiter who's actually good at their jobs prefers the tipping system. 

>  I've heard that you have barely any laws that protect you from for example Facebook to steal your data

Facebook doesn't steal data. If you create an account on Facebook, the agreement is that they get to use whatever data you give them. If you don't want to give data to Facebook, don't use Facebook. Simple as that. 

>  I generally just heard that your bosses can use you as slaves

Slavery is quite literally very illegal.

For some people I suppose. But most college graduates make a good amount of money eventually, and 92% of Americans are insured.

Either employee or employer can end the relationship at any time. There is no such thing as a special ""zero hour contract"" in the US because the flexibility able to set and change hours and schedules is a given.

State laws generally govern the basic things that would be considered a contract. State law requires employers to pay the wages/benefits they advertised. A Massachusetts law for example is worded like this: ""If an employer offers any holiday or vacation payments to an employee as part of an oral or written agreement regarding their employment, these payments will be considered as wages under this law""

As you can see the basic protections of getting the benefits and pay you were promised for the hours you work, are written into state law, often with no need for a formal written or signed contract - and there isn't really anything to agree on besides that. Though most employers will outline the basic pay/benefits in a short ""offer letter"" and have employees sign it as a formality.

College:  College prices can be higher than that, especially at the more expensive colleges, but most students don't have to pay the full price.  Colleges sometimes lower the price for poorer students.  Failing that, student loans are offered by the the government, and unlike regular loans, the required payment is limited to a small fraction of your income, and remaining debt is completely forgiven in 10 to 25 years.

Public transport:  Many of us prefer to use cars because we'd rather not ride with strangers and can leave at any time and go directly to the destination.  Nearly everyone has a car and even poor people can usually afford them.

Waiters:  They often make a great deal of money from tips.

Of course many of those complaints are made by Americans.  It's less clear why those specific people don't leave, but perhaps it is because they are paid more money in there jobs in the US than they could earn elsewhere.  Or perhaps they just enjoy a smug sense of superiority about the fact that, unlike their neighbors, they are capable of seeing how awful the US is.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 15:44:46,2023-11-21 15:45:05.372020

I don't have time to go through all the claim, but let's take a look at this one as an example:

>I've heard that waiters at the restaurants can even be paid SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR and are supposed to live off of tips that guests leave! 

Waiters only legally have to be paid minimum wage here, but that's true in other countries as well. And servers themselves overwhelmingly prefer to work for tips ([this survey](https://www.nmrestaurants.org/tipped-wage/) puts the number at 97%) because they can make more money that way. In several instances, restaurant owners who attempted to abolish tipping at their restaurants lost their workers and had to revert back to tipping in order to hire a staff again. 

If you want a personal example too: I was a server in college, and I could sometimes clear $300 a night. Not everyone makes that much, but it's very possible to earn a decent living as a server. 

So, basically, the short answer to your question is that you don't have an accurate picture of what the life in the U.S. looks like, and most people aren't desperately attempting to flee the country because they *don't want to*.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 15:51:16,2023-11-21 15:51:30.271037

This idea that some people spread that on any random day you come into work you might get fired for no reason is mostly crap. That's not something that people with full time jobs worry about on a day to day basis. It's rarely the first step in solving a problem for a company. In many companies there are set procedures of ongoing documentation of problems before you can fire anyone, no matter what is technically allowed by the law. The real world is not this fantasy black and white world that people talk about.

I work as a contract IT worker so I see inside the guts of many different businesses. They have to talk to me to take someone off the email system for instance, when they let them go.

54kl92mc,ka67bia,17zzy9m,"We'll ignore the mildly insulting nature of the hypothetical. et's break down your post point by point:

> Because every time I hear something about the US on the internet its something bad.

Normal average things - ""Oh, I drove 15, 20 minutes to work. Got coffee. Have decent pay, could be better."" - these aren't ever going to be in the news, because why would they? They're normal things, not news. And as for positive things, there is a financial incentive to stirring outrage, not positivity, and the U.S. (with vary levels of accuracy) makes an easy target.

> I heard that you have close to no public transport, no high speed trains

On the first point, you're partially wrong. Public transport *does* exist in major cities (Altanta, New York, LA, etc) no different than what you're used to. It's when you get in less densely populated areas that it can become less reliable, by virtue of longer routes, less vehicles, and yes, in some very rural areas no direct bus service. But it's no absolutely non-existant. As for high speed train, there *is* the Acela, but beyond that this *is* a point of criticism. The problem is because of how far we've got sonce moving away from long distance *passenger* rail, it's now an uphill battle to undo.

> you have no small shops in your suburban areas 

Im not going to sugarcoat my response to this: this is such an unbelievably wrong take it doesn't merit further discussion. Stores exist in suburbs, *otherwise people wouldn't live there.*

> that your lives are generally addicted to cars. 

We're not *addicted* to cars, the problem (and it *is* a problem) is that our infrastructure became ***too*** car centric in many places.

> I've heard that waiters at the restaurants can even be paid SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR and are supposed to live of of tips that guests leave!

Please stop it. What you're missing is that in these scenarios, IF a waitstaff's tips do not meet the minimum wage, it is the business's responsibility to make up the difference. Now, there *are* issues with minimum wage, but you'll be surprised how many waiters/waitresses *don't* want tipping abolished. They just want to improve the minimum wage beneath it, for obvious reasons.

> I've heard that you have barely any laws that protect you from for example Facebook to steal your data, I've also heard that the new YouTube Anti Adblock thing violates European laws, but yours doesnt, 

Please actually do some research into this. The U.S. *does* have data protection laws, in some cases they are less stringent than the EU, correct, but they *do* exist. And these are nowhere near reason to leave the country. 

> also I generally just heard that your bosses can use you as slaves 

Shut up. I don't care you're 13, you're old enough to understand exaggeration. 

> that paying off college or hospital billwoululd cost more than what you earned your whole life.

While this is mildly exaggerated, thete's a reason there are efforts to fix this...

> Also IMO having the possibility to buy a gun in the first supermarket is stupid and generally having the right to everyone have its own weapon of mass destruction is stupid, but I don't want to get into that today as its not the topic of this post.

Well them if you didn't want to discuss it you shouldn't have mentioned it. First off, let me be loud and clear, ***you cannot buy guns in just any store you walk into.***

Let me repeat:

***You cannot buy guns in just any store you walk into.***

vna10,ka67ds7,1805plq,"The dean at my wife's business school would invite all the international students to his place for Thanksgiving each year, since they typically wouldn't have plans otherwise. I joined them for the holidays (I was working alone elsewhere at the time). 

After dinner, the dean pulled out a game of Monopoly for everyone to play. I knew the rules already, but decided to just be banker and referee for everyone else.

Keep in mind that this is a bunch of business students, none of whom had any previous experience with Monopoly. They came from all different walks of life. The game turned into the most incredible dealmaking session I had ever seen. I made sure everyone followed the rules, but as people realized what and how they could sell their property to each other, coordinate in auctions, and update their strategies, they started major M&A deals with each other. Oftentimes, they would let one of themselves go nearly bankrupt (they called themselves ""$1 partners"") and started working together.

af3vy,ka68yqp,17zzy9m,"> Why don't Americans move out of the US? 

For one...it's very expensive and very difficult to move to another country. There are robust laws for immigration to another country. I cannot simply submit an employment application for a position in another country, take an interview, get hired, and then move across the world. 

Countries in the Anglosphere aren't exactly paving the way for us to get there and most native Americans don't speak another language fluently because there's no need for us to do so. 

Why don't you speak Swahili? Because you never encounter someone else who speaks it? That's why I don't speak German or Italian. I've never in my life been in a situation where I'd need Italian or German. 

We simply don't have the international interaction that Europeans do. We have oceans on 2 sides, Canadians who speak English on top, and an entire subcontinent below us who speak mostly Spanish but most of those people are trying to get here rather than us trying to get there. Many of us speak enough Spanish to go on vacation to Mexico, but with English being the default *lingua franca*...everyone else speaks our native tongue enough to get by when interacting.

> Because every time I hear something about the US on the internet its something bad.

You're watching content that tells you how awful life is, but none to show you how good life is. You're stuck in an algorithm of negative content. It's a self-perpetuating loop. 

What about watching [Stephen Fry experience college football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8) or [explaining his favorite city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lhFmLRpoR8)? There's tons of content on YouTube of European travelers coming to the US and having a wonderful experience.  

> you have close to no public transport

It's admittedly and obviously not as robust as Europe's. Have you considered that since this has always been the case that we may have adapted to this situation and have figured out ways to get around?

> no high speed trains

The US has far less population density than Europe and our population boomed in the age of the plane and the automobile. We use planes to travel long distances. 

> you have no small shops in your suburban areas

This is just silly. 

> your lives are generally addicted to cars

Did you notice how you used negative language here? I view a car as a tool. It's a useful method of transportation in a very decentralized and spread out area. 

> I've heard that waiters at the restaurants can even be paid SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR and are supposed to live of of tips that guests leave! It shouldn't be the guests responsibility to pay off a waiter. Tips are supposed to be something that the guests leave if they feel like the staff did something great etc etc. Or I am just biased by my European knowledge because I never was outside of Europe.

Yes, you're biased and so am I. This is a cultural difference. Tipping at restaurants is simply normal here. 

Having worked in and having many people I know who have worked in restaurants, tipping usually results in being paid MUCH more at the end of the day than a ""living wage"" or whatever. The only conversation in my life that I see that treats tipping in a negative fashion is here, on reddit. I made $25-50/hr delivering pizzas 25 years ago due to tips. Domino's is not going to pay me $50/hr, there's absolutely no way. 

IMO removing tipping will raise the floor for some workers in some places but it would eliminate the ceiling for everyone and result in lower overall pay, worse service, and fewer people wanting to go into the restaurant industry. Customers here do not want to pay more for food so employees get higher wages. The margins in the industry are razor-thin. If a place raised their prices 20% overnight turn that over to staff, they'd lose customers, immediately. 

>  I've heard that you have barely any laws that protect you from for example Facebook to steal your data
> 

Our laws are very different, [but they certainly exist.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/04/21/us-data-privacy-protection-laws-a-comprehensive-guide/?sh=5df4cf695f92). You're also probably completely naive as to how companies are using your data in Poland, because they certainly do.

> I've also heard that the new YouTube Anti Adblock thing violates European laws, but yours doesnt,
> 

I'm busy and have things to do and don't spend time online breathlessly fussing over watching a 5 second ad before free content. If a product is free, you're paying for it somehow. My life is not changed because I saw a 5 second ad before I watched ""This Week Tonight"". European laws can't pivot immediately to new changes in tech any better than we can.

> I generally just heard that your bosses can use you as slaves

Come on man, you've got to admit that the hyperbole you're using here is extremely thick. We have different labor laws, we don't have zero labor laws.

> and that paying off college...cost more than what you earned your whole life

How do we have doctors, engineers, attorneys, scientists, and all of those professions if 4 years of college costs more than a lifetime of earnings?

> or hospital bill would...cost more than what you earned your whole life
> 

I'm 46 years old and have never had a hospital bill. Is it possible that what you know about our health care and insurance might be...not the full story?

> having the possibility to buy a gun in the first supermarket is stupid

Different cultures have different ideas. Ours was funded on individual freedom, which includes firearms. We're not the only country that has guns. How do you feel about the firearm laws in Czechia or Italy? You can carry handguns there too.

> generally having the right to everyone have its own weapon of mass destruction is stupid

It would be, we don't have that. Unless you just mean a gun that has a magazine.

>  So why wouldn't you want to move out for example to Canada?

This assumes that I view all of the things you pointed out in the same way that you do. Since I grew up here and my family has been here for more than 100 years and I'm an adult and have traveled and have a career and a house and a life and stuff, my perspective is rather different than a 13 year old in an endless loop of negative YouTube content.

Canada? Canada has really tough immigration policies. You can't just ""get a job there"" and move. There's an entire infrastructure of bureaucracy to go through. 

We don't have open borders or an EU-like arrangement with the Canadians. If we did, they'd be moving here, not the other way around. They're already having a brain-drain due to their doctors and scientists and engineers leaving Canada due to their lower wages and high cost of living.

Even if I did ""want"" to move to Canada and had an opportunity. My entire life is here. My family, my friends, all of my relationships, everything I own, etc. So I'd have to choose to leave all of that behind for...*different* health care (by the way, Canadian health care is in a crisis, [they send patients here for care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115892/#:~:text=Faced%20with%20long%20waiting%20lists,US15000%20\(%C2%A39375\)%20each.)) ?

Employment lawyer here (but not yours, this is not legal advice, etc).

Part of the issue is that when American employees sue their employers, it's almost never a ""breach of contract"" cause of action. Instead, people sue under one of the many federal or state laws that govern employment relationships. The reason is that those statutory causes of action usually allow the employee to recover attorney's fees, while breach of contract claims generally don't. 

Really, I only see breach of contract claims from employees for issues like severance -- because there is generally no entitlement to severance except where the parties have negotiated it as part of an employment contract, and it doesn't really fall under traditional wage-and-hour laws. 

The other part of the issue is that at-will employment can make employment contracts somewhat illusory. It doesn't really matter what your contract says if your employer can unilaterally change some of the terms.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 16:12:32,2023-11-21 16:12:44.269549

a1qu9i68,ka6ah82,17zzy9m,"- Public transport: Some places yes, some places no. Our rural areas are much larger than yours. Montana is the size of Germany with 1.3% of the population. Public transit is overall less widespread here, but certainly not non-existent - especially in larger cities.

- Tipped wages: The employees who are in ""tipped"" jobs are the ones who are most strongly opposed to changing that system. While the occasional person who doesn't tip according to cultural norms exists, most do. They generally make much more than they'd be likely to if they were paid ""normally"" for what is often a relatively entry-level job in terms of skills.

- The US currently has poor data privacy laws, true. That said, Europe's are also bad, just in different directions. The EU currently looks like it's going to ban pretty much ban functional encryption in communications so the government can be certain that it's able to spy on everything you do at all times. While I'd rather no one steal my data, the direction Europe's going is even more concerning.

- Employment - generally speaking Americans get paid significantly better (especially at the professional/white-collar level), work slightly more, and get slightly less time off.

- Higher education - there are many ways to go to college pretty affordably, and the general data is that those who do make out substantially better in lifetime earnings. That said, if you want to go to a small, extremely expensive private college to major in something which doesn't translate to high earnings very frequently, sure, you can put yourself in a pretty bad debt hole.

- Healthcare - Roughly 92% of the country has health insurance of some kind, which mostly removes the ""surprise $100k bill after an accident"" type of thing.

d4f3haqs,ka6bhth,180du7n,"I think this question demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of the US's relationship to its allies, the US-Taiwan relationship, and the dynamic between Taiwan and China.

First. Even if it would be a good idea (it wouldn't) for the US and its allies to recognize Taiwan, the US doesn't have the ability to simply ""rally our allies"" to take a stance that would be incredibly provocative to China, and not really in their own self interests. Yes, we can count on our NATO allies (and they can count on us) as defensive partners, but we have no real ability to coerce them to take such a stance, much less commit to militarily defending Taiwan in the case of a Chinese invasion. China wouldn't be facing all of western Europe and multiple nuclear armed nations - they would be facing Taiwan's defense force, whatever the US can bring to the theatre, and *possibly* forces from Japan, Australia, and some other Indo-Pacific nations (although, it's entirely possible that friendly local nations would prefer to sit out a war to hedge their bets in case China won and dramatically increased it's influence in the area). 

You also don't really seem to understand the dynamic betweek Taiwan and China. Yes, arming Taiwan makes China angry. But this action helps *prevent* war. Taiwan has many natural defenses against invasion that already make it a tough nut for China to crack, and the addition of advanced Western weapon systems and likely support from the US Airforce and Navy are a very credible deterrence from a Chinese invasion. In short, even if China focused the entirety of its military might on trying to invade Taiwan, there's a good chance that they would fail. China knows this, and there's no doubt that the possibility of failure (or an incredably bloody victory) plays into their decision making. 

The ""One China"" status quo is also more important than you seem to realize. Right now, China can go about pretending that Taiwan is just a rebellious provence that they will get to in time. However, as soon as world powers start recognizing Taiwan as an independent state, China will be put in a dilemma   - either renounce their claims to Taiwan, or invade to prove their authority over the region. Taiwan is too important to China both strategically and in terms of prestige for them to simply give it up. Even Taiwan seems to understand this which is why Taiwan hasn't declared independence from China, but rather continues to cliam to be the legitimate government of mainland China - they aren't delusional, they're just  doing their part to maintin the ""one China' status quo to avoid forcing China's hand.

Because of this, arming Taiwan while maintaing strategic ambiguity is the option that is *least* likely to lead to a war in the region. China faces a real deterrent force in the region (one that doesn't depend on our European allies who would almost certainly be unable to lend any meaningful assistance), and there is no impetus for them to invade.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 16:22:28,2023-11-21 16:22:42.022728

This would normally include a statement that the employment is ""at will"" so the employer can terminate the employee at any time, without having to provide any reason, and also the employee can quit at any time.  Regardless of any agreement, it is always illegal to terminate an employee for certain reasons such as racial discrimination (though it is not always obvious whether an illegal reason was involved) and any employee who leaves most be paid for work done up to that point.

Additionally because this was the height of the Cold War, many feared that his assassination was the opening shot to WWIII.

9jonw,ka6dxkt,1809xqt,"My boys are still at junior school level, but are in a selective private “through school” (i.e. they automatically get to transfer into the senior school bit of the same school in Year 7).  Four things really stand out:

1 - Much better access, from a much earlier age, to facilities for sports, music and lots of other more niche hobbies.  
At my local state comp, you could only really do sport outside of PE lessons if you were good enough to play in the school team (competing for a place with all of the other boys in your year, from a year of about 130 boys and 130 girls).  Even within PE lessons, teachers only paid you any attention if you were in one of the school teams.  So if you weren’t already in the school teams, you basically had no facility to get into any sports. Similarly with music, a small minority of children were lucky enough to be selected to learn how to play an instrument, and they got to play in the school band/orchestra, but for everyone else there was essentially nothing. 

At my son’s private school (all boys), they have multiple teams for each sport, so everyone has an opportunity to play if they want to.  Teams are still banded by ability, but the other private schools in the area also work on a similar basis, so everyone can play in competitive fixtures no matter their level.  In lessons, everyone gets coaching and training, so everyone has the chance to improve.  For music, anyone can seek tuition in any instrument they like, and there are multiple bands, choirs and orchestras of different levels for people to join, to suit their ability and music taste.  By the time the boys get through to their Sixth Form years, many of them are Grade 8/Diploma level, and the concerts they put on are professional quality.  All of the more junior boys, even if not playing in those more elite orchestras yet, get the opportunity to go and watch those concerts and are encouraged to think about what they can learn from them to help their own playing.  

Clubs for other hobbies didn’t really exist at my school - one physics teacher held a chess club two lunch times a week, but that was about it.  At my sons’ school, they are given a timetable at the beginning of each term with the various clubs that will be meeting at lunchtimes and after school each day.  These cover a wide range of interests, from chess club, board and card games club, logic puzzles club, film club (watching and thinking about films), film making club, electronics club, space club, knitting club, sewing club, cooking club, art club, art history club, philosophy club, library/reading club, and on and on - the booklet explaining what each club involves runs to about 30 pages each term.  Plus, if you have a new idea for a club, the school will help you find a teacher to oversee it and help you set up and run it.  This is on top of the sports/music opportunities.  Boys are encouraged to do at least two after school clubs and two lunch-time clubs a week, and to branch out and try new things each term.  

All of this is facilitated by the teachers, almost all of whom (including head/deputy head) will be spending at least one evening a week running an after school club.

2 - Much better teacher engagement with parents.  
At my school, the teachers would be polite to parents on parents’ evening, but otherwise didn’t really care who they were.  You couldn’t contact any individual teacher outside of that parents’ evening window, and the school front office wasn’t generally interested in any parents wanting to discuss any issue about their child.  At my boys’ school if I have anything I want to raise about either of my sons - be it academic, behavioural, about how they’re getting on with the other boys, or just that they forgot their swimming goggles that morning - I can email any of the teachers, and I’ll usually get a response within 2 hours.  If there’s something that requires more than an email, I can arrange a time to speak with the teacher by phone (or these days Zoom), or catch them at the end of the school day.  That works both ways, and teachers will also contact us directly (usually by email) with any particular points to note about the boys.

3 - In-class behaviour.  
My school was the local state comp in a pretty run-down West of Scotland area.  It wasn’t selective, and every class up to GCSE level was mixed ability with a lot of kids that were academically weak and several that were frequently disruptive.  Teachers (understandably) spent a lot of time dealing with those children, and the more inherently capable were left to their own devices a lot of the time.  That was fine - it meant that the more capable kids also learned to study independently - but it meant there was little to no opportunity to try to stretch the more capable kids.  My sons’ school is academically selective, and while there is still a range of ability levels, the kids at the bottom of the academic ladder and the disruptive kids just aren’t there.  All of the boys therefore get more time spent with the teacher helping them at their level, meaning that the middling kids improve and the better kids get stretched onto new and interesting material. 

4 - Workload.  
At my primary school, homework was about 10-15 mins reading and writing a day, almost exclusively on maths and English.  At secondary school this increased, but still I would seldom have more than 45 minutes’ homework a night, and almost never anything on weekends.  The school day was 9 to 3:30.  

For my sons, the school day starts at 8:15 and finishes at 4 (not including after school clubs).  They will have a minimum of 45 minutes homework a night (not including any music practice), over several subjects.  Each weekend, they will have a larger “project” style exercise to do, which will be related to the term class topic and will often involve making a model out of wood/card, researching some topic and making a poster about it, coming up with a poem about something, etc.  The tacit assumption is that parents will help younger boys with these, but then hopefully they will be working on them independently by the time they reach Year 6.


So overall, my boys are busier and a lot more tired than I was at their age, but they are already streets ahead of where I was at an equivalent age, particularly in the non-academic fields.",AskUK,2023-11-21 16:37:26,2023-11-21 16:37:42.716395

k6f13w6h,ka6edkp,180inxr,"IMO the theoretical safety benefits are massively overstated.    The idea of this came from  industrial  sites where an ability to GTFO the site in a big hurry is important.    Less relevant to super markets.

Think about the classic “running over small children”.   Are small children less likely to be supervised properly by a parent walking with trolley to their car ….. or when said parent is battling with their shopping in a reverse parked boot?    If you reverse in, you have two opportunities to kill children - one as you reverse down the road way, and the other as you get in the space and squish the child from the car next door who is playing hide and seek.    If you drive in and reverse out, you’re hopefully reveasing into controlled children under decent supervision.   I’m not saying one is better than the other, but I don’t see a massive safety case for reverse parking.     


Whether I do it or not depends on the car park.   A busy shop car park?  Drive in every time.  Easier to claim the space, easier to load the boot and when you reverse out, people let you out because they want your space.    Work car park?   Don’t have a real preference, sometimes I do, sometimes I don‘t.   If the car park has narrow lanes and spaces, probably reverse in.",AskUK,2023-11-21 16:40:10,2023-11-21 16:40:24.224297

I can maybe understand for shopping, though I've never personally struggled getting to the boot when reversed, but any time else it's just pure inability.

It's safer to back in. You objectively have more control and a better view. It's also objectively easier than going forwards because of where the turning point is.

And often, it's quicker.

347w4x3t,ka6fjf4,180ibiv,"It seems this is another example of"" separated by a common language"". employment  in both nations is quite similar. There are some details that differ, but for the most part , in some cases the The US term ""at will"" asn the UK term ""Employment Contract"" are the biggest issue. 

To an American, in *general*, a contract is a **specific** type of legal document signed by two parties enforceable by law. When applied to employment, it denotes an agreement specifically negotiated with an employer for a set amount of time (e.g. Military contract, athletes, C- level employment). The contract is in force until the term ends or one party breaches the agreement. Yes, accepting the job at McDonald's comes with a bit of paperwork, and one of those pages *is* a contract, it is just not what we see as a ""contract"". 

The British misunderstanding is ""at will"". This creates an image that you can be fired at the whim of the employer and there are no worker protections. While that is *partially* true, a person *can* be fired for no reason, a *lack of reason* creates a potential legal liability. At will simply means I can leave my employment (end the contract) at *any time* for *any reason*, and my employer can terminate my employment(end the contract) at any time for ***almost*** *any reason.* There are several illegal reasons for termination, both on a Federal level and at the state/ local level. 

The biggest difference, as far as I can tell, is in notice and compensation of termination. 

US: No notice is needed to terminate employment form either party. No severance package is required to the terminated employee. A 2 week notice is a standard *courtesy* from employees, but is a *courtesy* not a requirement. It has been, in the last few years, challenged by younger Millennials and GenZ.

UK: Notice of contract termination *must* be given by either party. Sometimes up to a month. and a severance package is standard for most jobs. Exceptions for misconduct and egregious breach of contract , I'm sure exist.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 16:47:15,2023-11-21 16:47:28.078494

>that usually leaves offer letters, employee handbooks, and the limits of the law to define the relationship between the employer and employee.

Yes, it's the same here, along with implied terms - we just call this combination a contract. The one addition is that an employer gives a ""written statement of perculars"" which gives things like hours, pay & duties at the start of employment and on request. This can actually change wildly if duties change, but it doesn't take any more than me verbally agreeing to change my duties to make the change. And until I've worked somewhere over two years, employment protections are minimal. 

>Employment law.

Here, this would also be considered a statutory term of my employment contract - a type of implied contract term because ""not breaking employment law"" is so obvious it doesn't need to be expressed.

A minibus of terryfying, wasted women turned up. At some point, an altercation happened between some of the women and a younger girl (late teens/early twenties). Ended with one of the monstrous bus women slapping her and throwing a pint over her.

The girls brother, quite clearly a coked up scumbag, went nuts at the bus women (of which there were probably about 12) and started offering them out for a spot of northern street theatre.

The women, being built like some of Shredders' henchmen, were duly up for it.

It spilled outside into the carpark, and I duly found a nice spot on a wall a safe distance away, lit a fag and settled in for some entertainment.

I was not prepared.

Almost immediately, the scumbag brother pulled some knuckledusters out of his pocket and started throwing good punches, all head shots. It was absolute carnage. The beast women were going straight down, but then getting back up and going back in for more, just covered in blood and with noses at various incorrect angles. It was ridiculous. Like something out of Dead Rising with one guy fighting for humanity whilst the undead kept rising from their graves and trying to overwhelm him with their far superior numbers.

Seeing that the situation definitely needed escalating, his younger sister then came back (I hadn't realised she'd gone tbh) with an axe. Fortunately/unfortunately, the police turned up at the same time and halted the massive shit show.

Even if you can’t enjoy it all the time it makes a difference to have it some of the time.

You could collect all these papers and call them a ""contract"", but that's not the normal practice or how the term is used in the US.

If a company wants to bind an employee to a notice period (and provide a promise of severance pay in the event of termination) they will draw up a formal contract and both parties will sign. If the employee is covered by a union and the company and union have agreed to minimum wages and working conditions beyond what's required by law, then they (I'm not sure if its the union or the individual employees because I've never been in this situation) will create a formal written contract to make that agreement explicit.

Have you been to Cornwall?  Most of the times I have, it's rained.  And cost of living is way higher than Spain.

In your mum's situation, if she's set on the idea, I'd suggest considering trying to rent our her current house if she can make that work and rent somewhere ins Spain initially.  This way hopefully she might end up a bit off with the difference and can 'try it out', also while not getting stuck with somewhere in Spain.

Lots of British people do move to Spain and don't learn much/any Spanish.  I wouldn't want to, but it's still quite common sadly, especially if living in a British ""enclave"".

Firstly, I wanted to apologise for the way I worded my initial post. I wrote it fast while I was very upset so I might have came across as bratty which some of you pointed out. I wanted to say im not spoilt by any means in fact I try and encourage my mother to do her own things and live her own life while putting my feelings aside.

The main issue is how fast this unfolded. She has had big dreams in the past which unfortunately never actually work. If I had got some heads up months before about this I would have found ways to work around, looking for houses and jobs, but sadly I have not and I am now in a place of uncertainty.

For those wondering about visa. I sadly dont have an answer she hasnt discussed anything with me and is mainly talking to my sister who is encourgaing her so i do not know whats going on.

Every single person you see on television, with a couple of exceptions, was chosen to appear on television. Usually in at least some sense based on their looks. And not looking the part or being telegenic is absolutely a reason not to put someone on TV. This was even more true in the 1960s, much easier to actually enforce (since there were fewer channels making less content for fewer hours per day, and very little ""regular person on the street"" content), and social attitudes about body image were much narrower than they are today. There absolutely were fat people in the 1960s. They were considered not fit for television. 

I'm curious what a media comparison of 1960s content and similar 21st century content would reveal about body types and media.

Sure, in isolation. But every gun death together is a statistic.

Yep, by tackling the issues: poverty, healthcare, better empowerment of victims of domestic abuse... You know, things that will actually reduce the numbers and solve the problem.

In the first two years in the UK it's pretty similar to being at will in the US.  

I think your country strikes a really good balance personally.   One of the advantages of at will employment Is that employers will often take risks on new hires.  Let's say they find a non-traditional candidate for a position that they think can really add benefit to a department, but they don't really have all of the qualifications in the job listing.  In many European countries it would be very risky to sign a contract with this person because then if the person ends up sucking at the job, it's going to take a lot of work to get rid of them.  In the US it's not as big of a loss. They fire them and move on.  The UK system promotes this flexibility as well, while also giving longer tenured employees more security in their incomes.

b073in21t,ka6ka5n,17z50s8,"> Yep. But you're still expected to tip 20%.  
>
> I'm just saying how it is.

I should note there are restaurants in DC where the price is built into the price of the meals and you don't need to tip, so it's simply a matter of supporting those restaurants that just price their meals accordingly. So I don't think that needs to be how it is, at least in DC. Prop 82 doesn't take full effect until 2027 so DC is kind in a grace period where restaurants are doing different things.   

https://old.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/17zx6zl/its_this_or_we_close_this_service_fee_is_not_a/ka2b2mf/

""Slash Run did it recently, they announced a service charge on Instagram--then listened to the feedback and just raised their prices.""  

""Two Amy’s has hospitality built into the pricing. They’re doing fine.""

> Because of that, raising the tipped minimum wage barely even scratches the surface when it comes to solving the issue of wage theft. So if fear of wage theft is your reason for tipping, you should probably keep on tipping regardless of minimum wage changes, to help make up any wage theft your server might be suffering.

My understanding is that if all the $17 or so is on paystubs it makes it harder to commit wage theft.  

The way I see it, Prop 82 puts tipped workers on completely level ground with McDonalds and Chick-Fil-a and other minimum wage workers. [Wage theft could be occurring at McDonald's](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wmdgez/mcdonalds_has_been_slapped_with_a_wage_theft/), but I don't tip the McDonald's workers either.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-21 17:16:02,2023-11-21 17:16:15.522398

>In the first two years in the UK it's pretty similar to being at will in the US.  

They certainly do & I think there's a few on here who don't know how similar the first two years are & think we're more like the Euro model than we are. Although good employers do tend to carefully document everything before firing a bad employee, even in the first two years just to ensure they've got a good defence should the employee say they were fired for being the wrong gender/disabled/wrong ethnicity etc.

I'd assume that's the same Stateside.

>One of the advantages of at will employment Is that employers will often take risks on new hires.  

I'm actually a hiring manager & I never thought of this angle before, but yeah - I've definitely hired people with unconventional backgrounds that I may not have done if I was looking for perfect candidates only.

>But being able to quit my job tomorrow and not face legal action from my employer is also good as well.

Yeah, I agree & to be fair, I've never had an employer who didn't just let me use all my remaining holiday & then pay the rest of my notice out, because no one wants an employee who's already mentally checked out.

So if it still existed when that person learned world geography, and they don't have cause to think about central or south central Europe very much, then that bit of info might never get get updated in their mind.

Also, Americans don't get a lot of international news compared to other countries unless they really seek it out. This has gotten a little better since the internet became an everyday thing most people use, but it's still the case that we don't follow international news as much as other countries.

Backing in is definitely more challenging to most people, though.
